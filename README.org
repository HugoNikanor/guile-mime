* Guile Mime

This is a simple library for parsing and handling Mime types
in guile.

** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC guile
(use-modules (mime))

(mimetype "html")
$1 = "text/html"
(mimetype "htm")
$1 = "text/html"
(mimetype "rss")
$1 = "application/rss+xml"
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies

None

** Bugs

The parsing of the Mime file might be slightly wrong,
the document specifying valid Mime types was way to long.
But it does parse the Mime file on my system correctly.
