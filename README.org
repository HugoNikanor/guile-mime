* Guile Mime
  
This is a simple library for parsing and handling Mime types
in guile. It exports one function, ~get-mime-hash-table~.
The function takes one optional argument, which is the path
to the Mime file, and defaults to =/etc/mime.types=.
It returns a hash-table of all types in the file.

** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC guile
(use-modules (ice-9 hash-table)
             (mime))

(define mime (get-mime-hash-table))

(hash-ref mime "html")
$1 = "text/html"
(hash-ref mime "htm")
$1 = "text/html"
(hash-ref mime "rss")
$1 = "application/rss+xml"
#+END_SRC
   
** Dependencies
   
The library depends on my guile modules, which can be found
[[https:github.com/HugoNikanor/guile-lib][at GitHub]]. It's only the arrow macro I use, but I didn't feel
like including it in this repo also.

** Bugs

The parsing of the Mime file might be slightly wrong,
the document specifying valid Mime types was way to long.
But it does parse the Mime file on my system correctly.
